It’s written for beginners who just want their notes to sync safely.\n\n1) Why These Errors Happen\nThese problems usually occur when:\n\n\nYou edit notes on Device A\n\n\nYou edit the same notes on Device B\n\n\nBoth versions are different\n\n\nGit doesn’t know which version to keep\n\n\nSo it stops and asks you to resolve the conflict.\nThis is not a bug. It’s Git protecting your data.\n\n2) What a Merge Conflict Looks Like\nYou may see something like this inside a file:\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nMy local changes\n=======\nChanges from GitHub\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; origin/main\n\nMeaning:\n\n\nHEAD → your current device version\n\n\norigin/main → GitHub version\n\n\nGit is asking you which one to keep\n\n\nYou must remove these markers manually and choose the correct content.\n\n3) If Remote Version Is Correct (Easiest Fix)\nIf GitHub has the correct notes and your laptop has outdated ones:\nSafest method:\n\n\nDiscard local changes\n\n\nPull from GitHub\n\n\nThis makes your device match the remote version exactly.\n\n4) If Git Gets Stuck in Merge State\nSometimes even after discarding, Git still says:\n\n\n“Unmerged files”\n\n\n“Merge in progress”\n\n\nPull not working\n\n\nThat means Git is stuck halfway.\nClean fix:\nOpen Git Bash in your vault folder and run:\ngit reset --hard origin/main\n\nThis:\n\n\nRemoves conflict state\n\n\nDeletes broken local changes\n\n\nMakes your vault identical to GitHub\n\n\nYour data on GitHub remains safe.\n\n5) The BIGGEST Cause of Conflicts in Obsidian\nMost conflicts are NOT from notes.\nThey come from device-specific files like:\n\n\n.obsidian/workspace.json\n\n\n.obsidian/app.json\n\n\n.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-git/data.json\n\n\n.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json\n\n\nThese files change on every device automatically.\nSo Git keeps detecting “changes”.\n\n6) Permanent Fix: Use .gitignore\nYou should stop syncing those files.\nCreate a .gitignore file in your vault and add:\n.obsidian/workspace.json\n.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json\n.obsidian/app.json\n.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-git/data.json\n\nThen run:\ngit rm --cached .obsidian/workspace.json\ngit rm --cached .obsidian/workspace-mobile.json\ngit rm --cached .obsidian/app.json\ngit rm --cached .obsidian/plugins/obsidian-git/data.json\ngit add .gitignore\ngit commit -m &quot;Ignore device-specific Obsidian files&quot;\ngit push\n\nThis will:\n\n\nKeep files locally\n\n\nStop syncing them\n\n\nPrevent future conflicts\n\n\nImportant: Do NOT ignore the whole .obsidian folder.\nIt contains useful plugin and appearance settings that should sync.\n\n7) Correct Obsidian Git Settings (Best for Multi-Device)\nOn all devices, use:\n\n\nPull on startup → ON\n\n\nAuto commit → OFF\n\n\nPull on commit → OFF\n\n\nPush on commit → ON (optional via Commit &amp; Sync)\n\n\nThis setup gives you control and prevents background conflicts.\n\n8) The Golden Workflow (Follow Forever)\nEvery time you open Obsidian:\n\n\nOpen Obsidian\n\n\nWait 5–10 seconds (let pull finish)\n\n\nStart editing\n\n\nWhen finished:\n\nPress “Commit &amp; Sync”\n\nThat’s it.\n\n9) NEVER Do This\nDo NOT:\n\n\nEdit immediately after opening\n\n\nPush without pulling\n\n\nDelete files during a merge\n\n\nForce push unless you know what you’re doing\n\n\n\n10) Common Error Messages Explained\n“Updates were rejected (fetch first)”\nMeaning:\nRemote has new changes.\nYou must pull before pushing.\nFix:\nPull → then Commit &amp; Sync\n\n\n“Your local changes would be overwritten”\nMeaning:\nGit sees local modified files.\nFix:\n\n\nDiscard changes\n\n\nPull again\n\n\n\nWant to overwrite remote completely?\nOnly if you’re 100% sure:\ngit push --force\n\nWarning: This deletes remote history.\n\n11) Clean Multi-Device Rule\nWhether using:\n\n\nHome laptop\n\n\nOffice laptop\n\n\nMobile\n\n\nAlways follow:\nOPEN → WAIT FOR PULL → EDIT → COMMIT &amp; SYNC\nIf you follow just this one rule, conflicts almost disappear.\n\n12) Final Result\nAfter setting up properly:\n\n\nNotes sync smoothly\n\n\nAttachments sync\n\n\nPlugins sync\n\n\nLayout files stay local\n\n\nConflicts reduce drastically\n\n\nYour Obsidian vault becomes stable across all devices.\n\n13) Quick Recovery Checklist\nIf something breaks:\n\n\nClose Obsidian\n\n\nOpen Git Bash in vault\n\n\nRun:\n\n\ngit reset --hard origin/main\n\nReopen Obsidian.\nProblem solved in most cases.\n\nConclusion\nUsing Git with Obsidian is extremely powerful, especially for multi-device syncing. But Git requires a small amount of discipline:\n\n\nAlways pull before editing\n\n\nAvoid syncing device-specific files\n\n\nCommit regularly\n\n\nOnce configured correctly, it becomes a reliable and professional sync system.\nAnd the best part?\nYour notes stay fully under your control."},"GIT-setup-for-Obsidian/08-Quartz-Startup-Guide-=-From-Obsidian-Notes-to-a-Fully-Published-Website-(Step-by-Step-+-Real-Mistakes--and--Fixes)":{"slug":"GIT-setup-for-Obsidian/08-Quartz-Startup-Guide-=-From-Obsidian-Notes-to-a-Fully-Published-Website-(Step-by-Step-+-Real-Mistakes--and--Fixes)","filePath":"GIT

Building (Big Picture)\nWe are creating an Obsidian-Publish alternative using this pipeline:\nObsidian Notes\n      ↓\nGit (version control)\n      ↓\nGitHub Repository\n      ↓\nQuartz (static site generator)\n      ↓\nGitHub Pages\n      ↓\nPublic Website\n\nThis becomes your:\n\n\nKnowledge base\n\n\nStudy portal\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nPersonal documentation site\n\n\nLong-term digital asset\n\n\n\n🪜 STEP 1 — Create a GitHub Repository\nGo to GitHub and create a new repository.\nExample name:\nmy-notes\n\nRecommended settings:\n\n\nPublic repository\n\n\nCan initialize with README (optional)\n\n\nThis repo will later host your website.\n\n🪜 STEP 2 — Upload Your Obsidian Vault to GitHub\nOpen Git Bash inside your vault folder and run:\ngit init\ngit remote add origin github.com/username/my-notes.git\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;first upload&quot;\ngit push -u origin main\n\nWhat this does:\n\n\nTracks your notes\n\n\nUploads them to GitHub\n\n\nCreates version history\n\n\nAt this stage:\nYour notes exist online — but not yet as a website.\n\n🪜 STEP 3 — Turn the Repo Into a Website (Basic Test)\nGo to:\nRepo → Settings → Pages\n\nSet:\nSource: Deploy from branch\nBranch: main\nFolder: /root\n\nGitHub will give a link like:\nusername.github.io/my-notes/\n\nThis confirms:\n\n\nGitHub Pages is working\n\n\nHosting is active\n\n\nBUT:\nIt will only show files — not a real website.\nThat’s where Quartz comes in.\n\n🪜 STEP 4 — Install Quartz (Website Engine)\nQuartz converts markdown notes into a real website with:\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nDark mode\n\n\nBacklinks\n\n\nGraph\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nSEO structure\n\n\nFirst Attempt (Common Beginner Error)\nTried installing using:\ngit clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz .\n\nError received:\nfatal: destination path &#039;.&#039; already exists\n\nWhy?\nBecause the vault folder already had files inside it.\nFix\nInstead:\n\n\nDownload Quartz ZIP\n\n\nExtract it\n\n\nCopy files manually into the project folder\n\n\n\n🪜 STEP 5 — Another Mistake: Wrong Folder Placement\nQuartz got extracted as:\nObsidian_Vault/quartz-4/\n\nThis is incorrect.\nCorrect structure should be:\nObsidian_Vault/\n  notes...\n  quartz/\n  package.json\n  quartz.config.ts\n\nFix:\nMove all Quartz files to the root.\n\n🪜 STEP 6 — Install Node.js (Required)\nQuartz requires Node.js.\nInstall from official site.\nThen verify:\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n\nIf both show version numbers → ready.\n\n🪜 STEP 7 — Install Dependencies\nInside the Quartz folder:\nnpm install\nnpx quartz build\n\nThis creates:\npublic/\n\nImportant concept:\npublic = the generated website\n\n🪜 STEP 8 — Major Structural Decision (Very Important)\nAt first, Quartz was inside the main vault.\nProblem:\n\n\nObsidian started showing system files\n\n\nVault looked cluttered\n\n\nHard to manage\n\n\nBetter Architecture (Recommended)\nObsidian_Vault/   → private notes\nquartz-site/      → website engine\n\nThis keeps:\n\n\nWriting clean\n\n\nPublishing controlled\n\n\nStructure professional\n\n\n\n🪜 STEP 9 — Understanding Quartz Content Logic\nQuartz publishes ONLY what is inside:\ncontent/\n\nMeaning:\nYou control what goes public.\nSmart strategy:\nPrivate vault → everything\ncontent/ → selected polished notes\n\n🪜 STEP 10 — First Build Error\nMistake:\nRan command inside wrong directory:\n/quartz-site/content\n\nError:\nENOENT: package.json not found\n\nFix:\nMove one level up:\ncd ..\nnpx quartz build\n\nLesson:\nAlways run Quartz commands where package.json exists.\n\n🪜 STEP 11 — Preview Locally\nQuartz v4 command:\nnpx quartz build --serve\n\nThen open:\nhttp://localhost:8080\n\nAt first → 404 page.\n\n🪜 STEP 12 — Critical Rule: Homepage Must Be index.md\nQuartz requires:\ncontent/index.md\n\nWithout it:\n→ Site shows 404\nFix:\nCreate:\nindex.md\n\n\n🪜 STEP 13 — Windows Extension Trap\nFile looked like:\nindex.md\n\nBut actually:\nindex.md.txt\n\nWindows hides extensions.\nFix:\nEnable “Show file extensions”\nRename properly.\n\n🪜 STEP 14 — Custom Page Title\nAdd frontmatter at top:\n---\ntitle: My Knowledge Hub\n---\n\nThis replaces the default “index” title.\n\n🪜 STEP 15 — Push Website to GitHub\nInside quartz-site:\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;Initial website&quot;\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin github.com/username/my-notes.git\ngit push -u origin main\n\n\n🪜 STEP 16 — Merge Conflict (Real Situation)\nError:\nCONFLICT (add/add): README.md\n\nCause:\nBoth local and GitHub had a README.\nFix:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;merge quartz site&quot;\ngit push\n\n\n🪜 STEP 17 — Website Not Loading (Final Configuration Issue)\nProblem:\nGitHub Pages was reading:\n/root\n\nBut Quartz builds into:\n/public\n\nFix:\nSettings → Pages\nBranch: main\nFolder: /public\n\nIf /public not visible:\ngit add -f public\ngit commit -m &quot;add public build&quot;\ngit push\n\n\n🎉 FINAL RESULT\nYour site goes live at:\nusername.github.io/my-notes/\n\nFully functional with:\n\n\nSidebar navigation\n\n\nHomepage\n\n\nGraph view\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nMarkdown rendering\n\n\n\n🔎 Is the Site Searchable on Google?\nYes.\nBut indexing takes time:\nTypical range:\n\n3 days → 3 weeks\n\nTo speed up:\nUse Google Search Console.\n\n💻 Is It System Dependent?\nNo.\nOnce hosted on GitHub Pages:\n\n\nWorks 24×7\n\n\nRuns from GitHub servers\n\n\nDoes NOT depend on your PC\n\n\nRemains online forever\n\n\n\n🔁 Daily Workflow (After Setup)\nWhenever you want to publish a new note:\n\nCopy note into:\n\nquartz-site/content\n\n\nRebuild:\n\nnpx quartz build\n\n\nPush:\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m &quot;update content&quot;\ngit push\n\nWebsite updates automatically.\n\n🧠 Suggested Structure for Growth + SEO\ncontent/\n  index.md\n  CA/\n  Concepts/\n  Blog/\n  Resources/\n  About.md\n\nThis supports:\n\n\nKnowledge hub\n\n\nStudy notes\n\n\nBlog posts\n\n\nPersonal brand\n\n\n\n🏁 Final Thoughts\nThe setup journey involved:\n\n\nConfusion\n\n\nFolder mistakes\n\n\nCommand errors\n\n\nMerge conflicts\n\n\nPath errors\n\n\nBuild issues\n\n\nBut every problem helped understand the system deeper.\nQuartz is powerful because:\n\n\nFree\n\n\nFlexible\n\n\nProfessional\n\n\nScalable\n\n\nOnce configured, it becomes a lifetime publishing engine.\nAnd the best part?\nYou now own your platform."},"GIT-setup-for-Obsidian/09-Quartz-setup---Full-Discussion":{"slug":"GIT-setup-for-Obsidian/09-Quartz-setup---Full-Discussion","filePath":"GIT setup for Obsidian/09 Quartz setup - Full Discussion.md","title":"09 Quartz setup - Full Discussion","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"🧭 Overall Architecture\nObsidian Notes (Markdown files)         ↓ Git Commit + Push         ↓ GitHub Repository         ↓ GitHub Pages (auto builds site)         ↓ Public website URL         ↓ Google indexes it\n\n🚀 Step-by-Step Setup (Best Method)\n1️⃣ Create a GitHub Repository\n\n\nGo to: github.com\n\n\nClick New Repository\n\n\nName it:\n\n\nmy-notes\n\nSet:\n\n\n\nPublic ✅\n\n\nInitialize with README ✅\n\n\n\n2️⃣ Connect Obsidian Vault to Git\nYou already installed Git, so:\nInside your vault folder:\ngit init git remote add origin github.com/username/my-notes.git git add . git commit -m &quot;first upload&quot; git push -u origin main\nNow your notes are on GitHub.\n\n3️⃣ Turn It Into a Website (GitHub Pages)\nThis is the magic part.\nGo to:\nRepo → Settings → Pages\nSet:\nSource: Deploy from branch Branch: main Folder: /root\nYou’ll get a link like:\nusername.github.io/my-notes/\nThat is your website 🎉\n\n🧱 Make It Look Like Obsidian Publish\nRight now it will just show files.\nTo make it look like a real website, use one of these:\n⭐ EASIEST: Quartz (Best for Obsidian)\nGitHub:\ngithub.com/jackyzha0/quartz\nIt converts Obsidian notes into a beautiful website.\nFeatures:\n\n\nBacklinks\n\n\nGraph view\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nDark theme\n\n\nAuto deploy via GitHub\n\n\nExactly like Obsidian Publish 😄\n\n🌍 Make It Appear in Google Search\nAfter your site is live:\n1️⃣ Wait\nGoogle usually indexes in:\n3 days → 3 weeks\n2️⃣ Submit manually (faster)\nGo to:\nsearch.google.com/search-console\nAdd your site:\nusername.github.io/my-notes/\nSubmit sitemap.\n\n🔄 Auto-Sync Workflow (Your Dream Setup)\nYour current Git workflow already supports this:\n\n\nWrite notes in Obsidian\n\n\nPress:\n\n\nCommit &amp; Sync\n\n\nGitHub updates\n\n\nWebsite updates automatically\n\n\n\nInstall Quartz (Obsidian Publish Alternative)\nThis will give you:\n\n\nBeautiful note pages\n\n\nDark mode\n\n\nBacklinks\n\n\nGraph view\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nAuto deploy when you push notes\n\n\n\n🧭 Do This Exactly\nStep 1 — Download Quartz\nOpen terminal inside your notes folder:\ncd path-to-your-vault\nRun:\ngit clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz .\nYes, the dot is important.\nThis will install Quartz INTO your current repo.\n\nStep 2 — Install Node.js (if not installed)\nDownload:\nnodejs.org\nInstall → restart PC.\nThen check:\nnode -v\n\nStep 3 — Setup Quartz\nInside same folder:\nnpm install npx quartz create\nChoose:\ncontent folder → your notes folder\n\nStep 4 — Build Website\nnpx quartz build\nIt will create a public folder.\n\nStep 5 — Push to GitHub\ngit add . git commit -m &quot;Added Quartz&quot; git push\n\nStep 6 — Change GitHub Pages Source\nGo to:\nSettings → Pages\nChange:\nBranch → main Folder → /public\nSave.\n\nError encountered:\nDr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/Obsidian_Vault (main) git clone github.com/jackyzha0/quartz . fatal: destination path &#039;.&#039; already exists and is not an empty directory. Dr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/Obsidian_Vault (main)\nThis is expected. Nothing is wrong.\nThe error happened because:\n\n\nYou already have:\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nA git repo\n\n\nFiles inside the folder\n\n\n\n\nQuartz tried to clone into an empty folder, but yours is not empty.\n\n\nSo we must use the correct method for existing repos.\n\n🛠️ Correct Way to Add Quartz to Existing Notes Repo\nDo NOT use git clone ... . again.\nInstead, do this:\nStep 1 — Download Quartz as ZIP\n\nOpen:\n\ngithub.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n\nClick:\n\nCode → Download ZIP\n\nExtract it.\n\nYou’ll get a folder like:\nquartz-main\n\nStep 2 — Copy Files\nOpen the extracted folder.\nCopy EVERYTHING inside it:\n\n\npackage.json\n\n\nquartz folder\n\n\nquartz.config.ts\n\n\netc.\n\n\nPaste into:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\Obsidian_Vault\n(Your vault root)\nWhen asked:\nReplace files?\nClick:\nYES\nThis is safe.\n\nStep 3 — Install Node Modules\nOpen Git Bash again in vault folder and run:\nnpm install\nWait 1–2 minutes.\n\nStep 4 — Build Site\nRun:\nnpx quartz build\nThis creates:\n/public\nThis is your website.\n\nStep 5 — Push to GitHub\ngit add . git commit -m &quot;Installed Quartz&quot; git push\n\nStep 6 — Final GitHub Pages Setting\nGo to:\nRepo → Settings → Pages\nChange:\nBranch → main Folder → /public\nClick Save.\n\n\nIn this screenshot, there is a mistake:\nObsidian_Vault  ├── 00 - Index  ├── 01 - Concepts  ├── ...  ├── quartz-4   ← ❌ WRONG PLACE\nI extracted Quartz as a separate folder inside the vault.\nBut Quartz must be placed in the ROOT of the vault, not inside a subfolder.\n\n🛠️ Fix (2 minutes)\nStep 1 — Open quartz-4 folder\nGo inside:\nObsidian_Vault/quartz-4\nYou will see files like:\npackage.json quartz.config.ts quartz/ public/ README.md\n\nStep 2 — Move everything OUT\nSelect ALL files inside quartz-4:\nCtrl + A Ctrl + X\nNow go back to:\nObsidian_Vault\nPaste:\nCtrl + V\nNow structure should look like:\nObsidian_Vault  ├── 00 - Index  ├── 01 - Concepts  ├── quartz/  ├── package.json  ├── quartz.config.ts  ├── Things to Learn.md\n\nStep 3 — Delete empty folder\nDelete:\nquartz-4\n\nStep 4 — Install Quartz\nOpen Git Bash in:\nObsidian_Vault\nRun:\nnpm install\n(wait 1–2 mins)\n\nStep 5 — Build website\nRun:\nnpx quartz build\nThis creates:\n/public\n\nStep 6 — Push to GitHub\ngit add . git commit -m &quot;Quartz installed&quot; git push\n\nStep 7 — Final GitHub Setting\nGo to:\nGitHub → Settings → Pages\nChange:\nFolder → /public\nSave.\n\n\nBut look everything’s now inside obsidian too. Yes 👍 this is NORMAL. Nothing is broken.\nWhat you’re seeing is expected because:\nYou pasted Quartz into the same vault that Obsidian opens.\nSo now Obsidian is showing:\n\n\nyour notes ✅\n\n\nquartz folder ✅\n\n\ndocs/content files ✅\n\n\nconfig files ✅\n\n\nObsidian simply shows every folder inside the vault.\nThis does NOT affect your notes.\n\n🧠 Why this happened\nQuartz needs to live in the vault root:\nObsidian_Vault/    00 - Index    01 - Concepts    quartz/    docs/    package.json    quartz.config.ts\nBut Obsidian displays everything inside the vault.\nSo you’re seeing Quartz system files too.\nThey are harmless.\n\n🟢 Recommended Fix (Best Long-Term)\n\nCreate a new folder:\n\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\quartz-site\n\nMove these OUT of Obsidian_Vault into quartz-site:\n\ncontent docs quartz package.json package-lock.json quartz.config.ts\n\nKeep ONLY notes inside Obsidian_Vault.\n\n\nWhy this is better\nQuartz will read notes from:\n../Obsidian_Vault\nSo:\n\n\nYou write notes normally\n\n\nQuartz builds site separately\n\n\nObsidian stays clean\n\n\nThis is how most people set it up.\n\n🧭 Final Clean Structure (What we’re creating)\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\    ├── Obsidian_Vault     ← ONLY your notes (Obsidian opens this)    └── quartz-site        ← Website generator (separate)\nObsidian will become clean again.\n\n🧹 Step 1 — Create new folder\nIn Windows Explorer:\nGo to:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\\nCreate a new folder:\nquartz-site\n\n📦 Step 2 — Move Quartz files OUT of vault\nFrom inside:\nObsidian_Vault\nMove these items to:\nquartz-site\nMove ONLY these:\ncontent docs quartz package.json package-lock.json quartz.config.ts public (if present)\nDo NOT move your note folders like:\n00 - Index 01 - Concepts 02 - Drivers ...\nThose must stay.\n\n📁 After moving, it should look like:\nObsidian_Vault (clean again)\n00 - Index 01 - Concepts 02 - Drivers ... Things to Learn.md\nquartz-site\ncontent docs quartz package.json quartz.config.ts\n\n⚙️ Step 3 — Tell Quartz where your notes are\nNow Quartz must read notes from your vault.\nOpen this file:\nquartz-site/quartz.config.ts\nFind a line like:\ncontentDir: &quot;content&quot;,\nChange it to:\ncontentDir: &quot;../Obsidian_Vault&quot;,\nSave.\n\n📦 Step 4 — Install &amp; Build (inside quartz-site)\nOpen Git Bash in:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\quartz-site\nRun:\nnpm install npx quartz build\nThis will generate:\npublic/\n\n\nPerfect 👍\nYou did it correctly. That screenshot looks EXACTLY right.\nYour structure now is clean:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\    ├── Obsidian_Vault   ← your notes (Obsidian opens this)    └── quartz-site      ← website engine (correct)\nAnd inside quartz-site I can see:\n\n\n.github\n\n\ncontent\n\n\ndocs\n\n\nquartz\n\n\npackage.json\n\n\nquartz.config\n\n\netc\n\n\nThis is the proper Quartz installation 👍\n\n🔴 One IMPORTANT change needed\nRight now Quartz is still looking at:\ncontent/\nBut your real notes are in:\n../Obsidian_Vault\nWe must connect Quartz to your vault.\n\n🛠️ Do This (Simple &amp; Safe)\nStep 1 — Open:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\quartz-site\\content\nDelete everything inside content\n(only demo files — safe to delete)\n\nStep 2 — Copy your notes INTO content\nCopy these folders from:\nObsidian_Vault\nInto:\nquartz-site/content\nCopy:\n00 - Index 01 - Concepts 02 - Drivers 03 - Templates 04 - Case Studies 05 - Mistakes 06 - Doubts 07 - Resources 08 - Attachments 09 - Interview Career Things to Learn.md\nDo NOT copy:\n.obsidian\n\nAfter copying, it should look like:\nquartz-site/    content/       00 - Index       01 - Concepts       02 - Drivers       ...\n\n📦 Step 3 — Install + Build\nOpen Git Bash in:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\quartz-site\nRun:\nnpm install npx quartz build\nWait 30–60 seconds.\nYou should now see:\npublic/\n\n🌍 Step 4 — Preview locally\nRun:\nnpx quartz serve\nThen open:\nhttp://localhost:8080\nYou’ll see your Obsidian notes as a website 😄\n\nIts actually the BEST way to use Quartz.\nAnd yes, you are 100% correct:\n\nOnly the files inside the content/ folder will be published to the website.\n\nNothing outside content/ will appear on your site.\n\n🧠 What this means (important)\nYour setup now works like this:\nObsidian_Vault        → Your full private notes quartz-site/content   → Only selected notes for public website\nSo you get full control.\nYou can:\n\n\nKeep personal notes private\n\n\nPublish only study notes\n\n\nPublish only selected topics\n\n\nSlowly add content over time\n\n\n\n🟢 Recommended workflow (very smart approach)\nInstead of copying everything, do this:\n\nKeep your main vault untouched:\n\nObsidian_Vault/\n\nInside:\n\nquartz-site/content/\nManually copy ONLY what you want public.\nExample:\ncontent/    Taxation/    GST/    DT/    Audit/    Index.md\nThis becomes your public knowledge website.\n\n🔥 Pro tip (used by many people)\nYou can treat content/ like:\n\n\nA “public notes” folder\n\n\nA “blog”\n\n\nA “study portal”\n\n\nWhenever a note is polished and clean:\n→ Copy it to content/\n\n🧾 Example strategy (perfect for CA prep)\nKeep private:\nMistakes Rough notes Interview prep Personal thoughts\nPublish:\nConcept notes Summaries Revision sheets Frameworks\n\n📦 Next step\nAfter you add at least ONE note into:\ncontent/\nRun:\nnpm install npx quartz build npx quartz serve\nThen open:\nhttp://localhost:8080\nYou’ll see your note as a website.\n\n📍 Where to run the commands\nGo to this folder in File Explorer:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\quartz-site\nThen:\nMethod 1 (easiest)\n\n\nRight-click inside the folder (empty space)\n\n\nClick “Git Bash Here”\n\n\nA black terminal window will open.\nYou should see something like:\nDr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site $\nThat means you’re in the correct place ✅\n\n📦 Now run the commands there\nType one by one:\nnpm install\n(wait till it finishes)\nThen:\nnpx quartz build\nThen to preview:\nnpx quartz serve\n\n🌐 Open the site\nAfter running serve, open in browser:\nhttp://localhost:8080\nYou’ll see your notes as a website.\n\nImportant note\nYou only need to run npm install ONE time (first setup).\nAfter that, daily usage is just:\nnpx quartz build\nor\nnpx quartz serve\n\nError\nLook at your terminal path:\n/d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site/content\nYou are running the command INSIDE the content folder ❌\nBut Quartz commands must be run from:\n/d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site\nBecause package.json is there, not inside content.\nThat’s why it says:\nENOENT: no such file or directory, open ...content/package.json\n\n✅ Fix (10 seconds)\nIn the same Git Bash window, just go one level up.\nType:\ncd ..\nNow your path should become:\nDr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site $\nThis is the correct place.\n\nNow run again:\nnpm install\n(wait till it finishes)\nThen:\nnpx quartz build\nThen preview:\nnpx quartz serve\nOpen:\nhttp://localhost:8080\n\nEasy way to remember:\nRun Quartz commands ONLY where this file exists:\npackage.json\nThat folder is:\nquartz-site\nNOT:\nquartz-site/content\nNext step: Preview the site\nIn the SAME folder (quartz-site) run:\nnpx quartz serve\nYou should see something like:\nServer running at http://localhost:8080\nOpen browser and go to:\nhttp://localhost:8080\nYou’ll see your website.\n\nIf the page looks empty\nThat just means:\nYou haven’t added notes yet to:\nquartz-site/content\nSo Quartz has nothing to show.\nJust copy 1 note into content to test.\nExample:\nCopy:\nThings to Learn.md\nInto:\nquartz-site/content\nThen run again:\nnpx quartz build npx quartz serve\nNow it will appear.\n\n✅ Correct command to preview site (Quartz v4)\nRun this instead:\nnpx quartz build --serve\nThis does BOTH:\n\n\nbuilds the site\n\n\nstarts local server\n\n\n\nWhat you should see after running\nTerminal will show something like:\nQuartz v4.x.x Local server started at http://localhost:8080\nNow open browser and go to:\nhttp://localhost:8080\n\nIf page looks empty\nThat means content/ has no notes yet.\nSo copy 1 test note:\nExample:\nCopy this file from your vault:\nThings to Learn.md\nPaste into:\nquartz-site/content/\nThen run again:\nnpx quartz build --serve\nNow you’ll see that note as a webpage.\n\n\nThat 404 page means:\n\nQuartz is running correctly, but there are NO notes inside content/ yet.\n\nSo it has nothing to show.\n\nWhy you’re seeing 404\nQuartz only shows pages that exist inside:\nquartz-site/content/\nRight now that folder is probably:\n\n\nempty\nor\n\n\nhas no .md files\n\n\nSo homepage = not found.\n\nImportant concept (key understanding)\nQuartz works like this:\ncontent/    index.md        ← homepage    gst.md    tax.md\nIf there is NO index.md, it shows 404.\n\nBest first test (recommended)\nInside content, create a file:\nindex.md\nPut this inside:\n# Welcome  This is my knowledge base.\nSave.\nRun again:\nnpx quartz build --serve\nNow homepage will open 😄\n\nHow your future workflow will look\nYou will:\n\n\nWrite notes in Obsidian (private vault)\n\n\nCopy selected notes into:\n\n\nquartz-site/content/\n\nRun:\n\nnpx quartz build\n\n\nPush to GitHub\n\n\nSite updates publicly\n\n\n\n\nYou DO have a note inside content, but Quartz still shows 404 because:\n👉 The homepage must be named exactly:\nindex.md\nRight now you have:\nThings to Learn.md\nQuartz doesn’t treat that as the homepage.\n\n🎯 Fix (10 seconds)\nJust rename this file:\nThings to Learn.md\nto:\nindex.md\nSo the folder becomes:\ncontent/    index.md\n\nThen rebuild\nIn Git Bash (inside quartz-site):\nnpx quartz build --serve\nNow refresh:\nhttp://localhost:8080\nIt will open 😄\n\nWhy this happens\nQuartz works like websites:\nindex.md = homepage\nSame as:\nindex.html\nWithout it → 404\n\nLater you can add more notes like:\ncontent/    index.md    gst.md    dt.md    audit.md\nThey will appear automatically.\n\n\nYou’re VERY close. The problem is small and I can spot it from your screenshot.\nYou renamed the file visually, but Quartz still isn’t detecting a homepage because one of these is happening:\nMost likely causes (one of these 100% is true)\n\nThe file is actually named:\n\nindex.md.md\n\nThe file is:\n\nindex.MD\n\nWindows is hiding extensions, so it looks like index.md but isn’t.\n\n\n🔍 Let’s verify properly\nGo to:\nquartz-site/content\nTurn ON file extensions:\nTop menu → View → ✔ File name extensions\nNow check the exact name.\nIt MUST be:\nindex.md\nNothing else.\n\nFix (safe method)\nDelete current file.\nCreate a fresh one:\nRight-click → New → Text Document\nRename it to:\nindex.md\nOpen it and paste:\n# Welcome  This is my public knowledge base.\nSave.\n\nRebuild\nIn Git Bash:\nnpx quartz build --serve\nRefresh:\nhttp://localhost:8080\n\nBefore we publish — important decision\nYour current structure is PERFECT:\nObsidian_Vault        → Private notes quartz-site/content   → Public notes\nSo you can now:\n\n\nCopy only selected notes into content\n\n\nKeep rest private\n\n\nPublish only polished content\n\n\nThis is the ideal system.\n\n\nBut the title index is also showing\nGood catch 👀\nThat “index” title showing at the top is normal — and easy to fix.\nRight now Quartz is using the file name as the page title:\nindex.md  →  title becomes &quot;index&quot;\nWe’ll override that.\n\n✏️ Fix the page title (proper way)\nOpen:\nquartz-site/content/index.md\nAdd this at the VERY TOP of the file:\n--- title: Praveen’s Knowledge Hub ---\nSo your file should look like:\n--- title: Praveen’s Knowledge Hub ---  # Praveen’s Knowledge Hub  Welcome to my public knowledge base.  ## 📚 CA Final Notes - Direct Tax - GST - Audit  ## 🧠 Concepts Deep explanations of financial and business concepts.  ## ✍️ Blog My learning journey, mistakes, and strategies.  ## 📁 Resources Templates, summaries, and revision tools.\n\nRebuild\nRun again:\nnpx quartz build --serve\nRefresh the page.\nNow the top title will be:\nPraveen’s Knowledge Hub\nNOT:\nindex\n\nWhy this works\nThat section:\n--- title: ... ---\nis called frontmatter.\nIt tells Quartz:\n\n“Use this as page title instead of filename.”\n\n\nOptional (make it look cleaner)\nYou can also change the site name (left sidebar top).\nOpen:\nquartz-site/quartz.config.ts\nFind:\npageTitle: &quot;Quartz 4&quot;,\nChange to:\npageTitle: &quot;Praveen’s Knowledge Hub&quot;,\nRebuild again.\nNow left side will show your name instead of Quartz 4.\n\n🚀 STEP 1 — Create GitHub repo (website host)\nGo to GitHub → create a NEW repository:\nName:\nnotes-site\nSettings:\n\n\nPublic ✅\n\n\nDO NOT add README\n\n\nDO NOT add license\n\n\nDO NOT add gitignore\n\n\nClick Create repository\n\n🚀 STEP 2 — Upload your quartz-site folder\nOpen Git Bash inside:\nD:\\Obsidian Vaults\\quartz-site\nRun these commands one by one:\ngit init git add . git commit -m &quot;Initial website&quot; git branch -M main git remote add origin github.com/pravee-n2/notes-site.git git push -u origin main\n(If Git asks login → sign in once)\n\n🚀 STEP 3 — Turn ON GitHub Pages\nOpen your new repo on GitHub:\nnotes-site → Settings → Pages\nSet:\nSource: Deploy from branch Branch: main Folder: /public\nClick Save\n\n🌐 STEP 4 — Your site URL\nAfter 1–2 minutes, your website will be live at:\npravee-n2.github.io/notes-site/\nOpen that link.\nYou should see your homepage exactly like localhost.\n\nError:\nDr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site (main) $ git push -u origin main To github.com/pravee-n2/my-notes.git !

Dr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site (main)\nSolution:\nPerfect — this error is normal 👍\nAnd I can see exactly what happened.\nYou accidentally connected this folder to your OLD repo:\nmy-notes\nBut we wanted a NEW repo:\nnotes-site\nSo Git is saying:\n\n“Remote already has files that don’t match your local files.”\n\nWe’ll fix it in 20 seconds.\n\n🔧 Fix (Safe &amp; Clean)\nYou just need to change the remote link.\nRun these commands inside quartz-site:\n1️⃣ Remove wrong connection\ngit remote remove origin\n2️⃣ Connect to the NEW repo (notes-site)\ngit remote add origin github.com/pravee-n2/notes-site.git\n3️⃣ Push again\ngit push -u origin main\n\n⚠️ Important check\nBefore Step 2:\nDid you already create this repo on GitHub?\nnotes-site\nIf NOT:\n\n\nGo to GitHub\n\n\nCreate new repo\n\n\nName:\n\n\nnotes-site\n\nKeep it EMPTY (no README)\n\nThen run the commands above.\n\nWhy this happened\nEarlier:\nmy-notes  → connected to Obsidian vault repo\nNow:\nquartz-site → must connect to website repo\nTwo separate repos:\n\n\nmy-notes → raw notes\n\n\nnotes-site → website\n\n\n\nAfter push succeeds\nGo to:\nnotes-site → Settings → Pages\nSet:\nSource: Deploy from branch Branch: main Folder: /public\nSave.\nThen your site will be LIVE at:\npravee-n2.github.io/notes-site/\n\nError:\nDr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site (main) $ git pull origin main —allow-unrelated-histories fatal: ‘origin’ does not appear to be a git repository fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.\nSolutions:\nDon’t worry 👍 nothing is broken.\nThis happened because earlier we removed/changed the remote, so now this folder is not connected to any GitHub repo.\nThat’s why Git says:\n&#039;origin&#039; does not appear to be a git repository\nIt simply means:\n\n“I don’t know which GitHub repo to talk to.”\n\nWe just need to reconnect it.\n\nWe’ll use the SAME repo (my-notes) — simplest way\nYou already have this repo:\ngithub.com/pravee-n2/my-notes\nNow reconnect quartz-site to it.\nInside Git Bash (in quartz-site), type:\ngit remote add origin github.com/pravee-n2/my-notes.git\nThen run:\ngit pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories\nThen:\ngit push -u origin main\n\nWhat this will do\n\n\nConnect quartz-site → my-notes repo\n\n\nMerge old notes + new website files\n\n\nUpload the website\n\n\n\nAfter push succeeds\nGo to:\nGitHub → my-notes → Settings → Pages\nChange to:\nSource: Deploy from branch Branch: main Folder: /public\nSave.\nAfter 1–2 minutes, your site will be LIVE at:\npravee-n2.github.io/my-notes/\nFully online.\nNot dependent on your PC.\nGoogle can index it.\n\nError:\nDr.Senku@Praveen MINGW64 /d/Obsidian Vaults/quartz-site (main) $ git pull origin main —allow-unrelated-histories remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done. remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0) Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 854 bytes | 122.00 KiB/s, done.
